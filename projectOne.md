Update and Upgrade Ubuntu installation by running

### STEP 1 â€” INSTALLING APACHE AND UPDATING THE FIREWALL
Apache HTTP Server is the most widely used web server software. Apache is an open source software available for free. It runs on 67% of all webservers in the world. It is fast, reliable, and secure. It can be highly customized to meet the needs of many different environments by using extensions and modules.

Install Apache using *apt* which is package (software) manager used in Ubuntu and some other Linux istributions.

```
sudo apt install apache2
```

Verify if apache is running with

```
sudo systemctl status apache2
```
If you see a green *active (running)* then you have done everything correctly. 

Use

```
 curl http://localhost:80
or
 curl http://127.0.0.1:80
 ```
 to confirm if our new web server is working correctly. You should some HTLM codes on your terminal as an indication that the Apache web server is working okay.
